<p style="margin-left:320px; margin-top:-120px">No, we are not talking about your run-of-the-mill vanilla, chocolate and strawberry, but ice creams that are encased in gold, those that are infused with booze and those that bring back ice cream parlour nostalgia from the 90s! These places are some of the best ice cream parlours in Hyderabad and serving the quirkiest ice cream flavours in town, one scoop at a time. Summer is getting sweeter! </p>

<p style="margin-left:320px; margin-top:-120px;">The Black Chocolate Monster (Hi goth ice cream trend!) at Icekraft made with edible activated charcoal and Nutella (or any flavour of your choice) is served in a black waffle cone for you to enjoy. If that’s not enough, we recommend their Tacos Platter where ice-cream rolls are stuffed inside waffles shaped like tacos. Go for the Chocolate Mexicana platter and thank us already!</p>

<p style="margin-left:320px; margin-top:-120px;">How cool would it be to have ice cream as a cure for all our illnesses? At Dr. Icecream in Jubilee Hills, it's possible! Done up as a hospital with stretchers and wheelchairs, the staff is dressed as doctors. No matter what your ailment—headache or heartbreak, there’s a cure for everything here. For digestion, a tamarind chili ice-cream with a caramel injection. And god forbid you’re suffering from a curious case of Hyderabadi fever, then there’s a Biryani-flavoured ice cream (yes, there is such a thing) with a hint of spice and infused with a caramel injection. Biryani ice cream is the only solution to this particular kind of malady!</p>

<p style="margin-left:320px; margin-top:-120px;">Bilal’s is one of the oldest ice cream parlours around, and it has iconic status. The Nizami architecture with old portraits and chandeliers and the old-world charm of its ambience are sure to brighten even a grim day. While their Anjeer Badam and Black Currant ice creams are pure joy, it’s their delicate rose petal-flavoured one that takes the glory. If you’re looking for something adventurous, their paan ice cream will satisfy their need.</p>

<p style="margin-left:320px; margin-top:-120px;">At Indulge, eat your ice cream and take home the dainty customised coffee cup it is served in. The parlour has an interesting spread of flavours that you’ll not find in the other ice cream shops of Hyderabad. Out favourite's are the African Dark Chocolate or Filter Kaapi.</p>
